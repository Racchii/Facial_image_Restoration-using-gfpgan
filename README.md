# Facial Image Restoration using GFPGAN

This project is a **Facial Image Restoration System** built using **GFPGAN (Generative Facial Prior-GAN)**.  
It enhances old, blurred, low-resolution, or damaged facial images using a pre-trained deep learning model while preserving natural facial details.

The system provides a clean and interactive **web interface using Flask**, allowing users to upload images and obtain restored results in seconds.

## 🚀 Features

- ✔ Real-time facial restoration using GFPGAN
- ✔ Enhances resolution, sharpness & facial details
- ✔ Supports multiple image formats (PNG, JPG, JPEG)
- ✔ Simple & responsive Flask UI
- ✔ Works locally (offline) after setup
- ✔ No complex ML knowledge required to use
- ✔ Fast inference on GPU (optional) and CPU-supported with slower processing

## 🧠 Model Overview — GFPGAN

**GFPGAN** (Generative Facial Prior-GAN) is a state-of-the-art GAN model trained on a massive facial dataset using facial priors for:
- Super-resolution
- Deblurring
- Restoration
- Detail enhancement
